                CyberLife is the world's leading android designer, manufacturer and retailer of androids. Founded by
                Elijah Kamski, CyberLife produces all kinds of androids from domestic assistants to teachers, doctors,
                police officers and even soldiers. Based in Detroit, we own the CyberLife Tower and five stores across
                the city, and have opened a plant in Milwaukee.
                <br>

                <br>After Kamski's invention of Thirium 310 and biocomponents, our RT600 android named Chloe publicly passed
                face-to-face Turing tests in 2022. With the demand, we started to mass produce. In 2024, CyberLife
                production line brought the ST200 leading to our company marketing the first android in Detroit. The
                ST200 is a personal assistance model that can speak several languages and perform most if not all tasks
                a human could accomplish.
                <br>

                <br>As the manufacturing and the demand for CyberLife’s androids increased, our Detroit-based CyberLife
                announced the release of five new models designed to serve in fields as diverse as domestic assistance,
                higher education, and medicine in 2027. The sales of android reached one million that year. We started
                to market an entry-level model at $4,999, democratizing androids for the general public.</p>
