            <p>Our androids are utilized in an almost all-encompassing breadth of life and job sectors. They are
                domestic staff, shop assistants, office work, laborers, mechanics, entertainers, medical staff, teachers
                from elementary up to university, unarmed law enforcement. They account for more than 80% of university
                professors and 63% of medical staff. Androids are manufactured by machines in automated CyberLife plants
                entirely based in Detroit.

                <br>
                <br>The removable parts, such as the limbs, are 3D-printed, assembled on a production line, and then the
                embedded synthetic skin is activated conforming to the specific model's appearance. A human operator
                initializes the android, checks the baseline cognitive abilities with a pre-established protocol. Any
                non-standard or defective androids are (usually) detected, then are deactivated and disassembled for
                analysis. Finally, the android is packaged and delivered to a CyberLife store to be sold.

            <p>RT600 "Chloe" was the first CyberLife android perfected by Elijah Kamski, released in 2021.
            <br>
            <br>As the first personal assistant built by CyberLife, she is designed to help humans with everyday tasks such
            as doing housework and making appointments. She is also the first android to pass the Turing test. By
            publicly passing face-to-face tests in 2022, Chloe ensured CyberLife's success.</p>

            <p>The Connor model includes a physical simulation software based on the analysis of elements of the crime scene. He can thus reconstruct past events by cross-checking the evidence at his disposal. 
<br>
               <br> It is also the first model to offer the analysis of biological evidence in real time, by direct sampling and ingestion of samples.
                <br>
               <br> The RK800 is a CyberLife RK-series prototype released in August 2038. Its function is to assist law enforcement and engage in investigative work. Unlike previous police android models, it is designed to take an active part in investigations.
                The RK800 has a wide range of intellectual and forensic abilities.</p>
