        <p>Our androids are utilized in an almost all-encompassing breadth of life and job sectors. They are
            domestic staff, shop assistants, office work, laborers, mechanics, entertainers, medical staff, teachers
            from elementary up to university, unarmed law enforcement. They account for more than 80% of university
            professors and 63% of medical staff. Androids are manufactured by machines in automated CyberLife plants
            entirely based in Detroit.

            <br>
            <br>The removable parts, such as the limbs, are 3D-printed, assembled on a production line, and then the
            embedded synthetic skin is activated conforming to the specific model's appearance. A human operator
            initializes the android, checks the baseline cognitive abilities with a pre-established protocol. Any
            non-standard or defective androids are (usually) detected, then are deactivated and disassembled for
            analysis. Finally, the android is packaged and delivered to a CyberLife store to be sold.
